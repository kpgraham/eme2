For those compulsive enough to look at the source, www.cthreepo.com has been my website since at lease 2001. The page source has been
rewritten hundreds of times and then rewritten with cut and paste. I am sure that some of this html goes back to 2001 when the site was an ASP site.
Several years before that it was on AOL. The code has since been on WordPress and then as a semi static site as www.kpgraham.com. Please do not
criticize me for the slap-dash approach to website development.
Currently my websites are hosted in my cellar on a 15-year-old windows machine using WAMP. I am in the process of moving it to a Raspberry Pi. I am
hosting this particular flavor of my websites on GitHub so that I can give out the URL without getting hugged to death.
