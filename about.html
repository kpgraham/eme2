<p>I am Keith P. Graham.</p>
<p>I have been a programmier/hacker since 1969. I wrote in assembly
language because that was as close to silicon as a hacker could get
without a soldering iron. I was a programming manager at Lockheed
Martin for 15 years, and then a consultant at IBM Watson Research
Center. I have sold about 80 Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror
stories.</p><p>I've been reading Science Fiction for a very long time. My
first contact was with a very kindly Librarian who steered me towards
SF Juveniles around 1957. I know it broke her heart to do it, but I had
asked for 'Space Stories' and it was much better that I read 'trash'
than not read anything at all.</p>
<p>About that time my cousin Jeff told me a bed time story. It
was the outline of a Heinlein novel and I was ruined for life.</p>
<p>I soon discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs and worked my way
through the Tarzan Series just about the time that the Mars novels
starting appearing in paperback. My Uncle Robert Hunt had boxes of
Astounding Magazine in his attic that I found one day. It turns out he
loved Science Fiction but, as a politician and prominent member of the
community, it was something that he kept quiet. I spent many hours in
that hot dusty attic reading crumbling yellow magazines from the 1930s
and 40s. (Unfortunately these treasures didn't survive a spring
cleaning while I was away at college.)</p>
<p>When I turned twelve I got a paper route. My profits were
about $5 per week. I spent 10 cents per day on cream soda, 10 cents per
week on Comics and about $2.50 on paperbacks. This was when SF books
cost 35 cents. The summer of my 13th year I read over one hundred
books. Three quarters of them were Science Fiction.</p>
<p>I've read a lot of books. 90% were crap - but 90% of
everything is crap. Bad Science Fiction is better than the best movie,
TV show, or sporting event. It wasn't until the the 1960s when I
discovered sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll that that I lost my book
a day habit.</p>
<p>Now in my 70s I listen to 2 or 3 audio books a month - with
the bonus that I can reread a book I read 20 years ago and not remember
how it ends. My Grandfather, an insatiable reader up to his death at
92, told me that the only advantage of getting old is that you can pick
up a book that you know you read last month and enjoy as though you
were reading it for the first time.</p>
<p>I am a computer programmer with more than 50 years experience.
In addition to ranting about SF I have many other strange and
interesting websites including the oldest and largest site on the
Internet dedicated to playing Blues Harmonica.</p>
